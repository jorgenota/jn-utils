# Jn Base

Some simple base utils to help build libraries and apps with out the need
of adding dependencies to larger libraries (such as _spring-core_ o _guava_).

They are mainly utils to check for empty Objects, several utils related to Strings, and preconditions to check for
method arguments and state.
